	<h1>Professional Experience</h1>
		<h3>Williams College</h3>
			<div class="indent">
				<p>Summer 2013 - Part time research in an experimental atomic physics lab at Williams College in Williamstown, MA.</p>
				<p>Worked with a vaccuum evaporator, coating optical components. Helped to construct Fabry-Perot optical cavities to test coated optics.</p>
			</div>
		<h3>Draper Laboratory</h3>
			<div class="indent">
				<p>Summer 2014 - Full time 11 week internship in the Electro-Optics and Instruments group at Draper Laboratory in Cambridge, MA.</p>
				<p>Work included constructing a Michelson interferometer and designing and building an optical bench setup in order to test the interferometer for its use in an intertial measurement unit containing an accelerometer and a gyroscope. Helped to build and maintain an optical setup to stabilize a laser's optical power for an atom interferometer. Gained experience in Matlab and Solidworks, analyzing results of eperiments and designing parts for a 3D printer/machine shop respectively.</p>
