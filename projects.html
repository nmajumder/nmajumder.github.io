            <p>Probably my favorite project I've ever completed, this was a final assignment in my Computer Vision class in Budapest while abroad. It was slightly open-ended, and I and two other students decided to work together on writing a program that would take in a video of an empty picture frame being moved around, and at some specified point in the video it would freeze the contents of the frame and for the rest of the video (or however long we wanted), the frame would look like it had the picture of the freeze frame shot in there.</p>
            <p>This project was a culmination of many techniques we learned throughout the semester, so the code base had been somewhat built up from previous assignments, but the functionality for the freeze frame was entirely written by us. The general flow of the program in terms of computer vision techniques is as follows:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>At a certain specified frame number (when we want to start freezing the image inside the picture frame), we perform a global feature detection for the four corners of the picture frames. We use a greenish marker as our feature, and attempt to find these markers by thresholding the relative rgb values and the brightness. We collect all of the points that fall into this threshold category, and then perform K-means on the points to get 4 clusters. We experimented with the threshold values for long enough that we are confident that K-means will find the correct points, even without multiple iterations. We take the centroids of these clusters and store them as the corners of the frame for future use, along with the image that we want to freeze. For all future frames, the process of finding the corners is much quicker, because we can perform a local feature detection around the location of the previous frame's corners.</li>
              <br>
              <li>After finding the corners of the frame (and already knowing the corners of the previous frame), we perform a Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) to find the 3x3 homography matrix H that maps all points x from image A to corresponding point x' in image B by the equation xH = x'. Note the points x are stored in homogeneous coordinates, so a point has form [x, y, 1]. Now, we can map all points from one image to the other (and vice versa using H inverse).</li>
              <br>
              <li>Finally, we use an inverse warp to take pixels from frame image A and paste them into frame image B to keep the illusion that the frozen image has followed the picture frame. Note, we use an inverse warp instead of a forward warp (which would go through pixels in image A and paste them to their location in image B), because if we instead iterate through all applicable pixels in image B and grab the corresponding ones from image A, we won't have spots in B that don't get mapped to. A surprisingly difficult first step in the warp is to even figure out from the corners which pixels on image B were inside the frame and needed to be mapped to, when we didn't know the orientation or shape of the picture frame at that instant. When we had equations of lines that outlined the frame, we iterated through the pixels within it and used the homography matrix to grab the frozen pixels and paste them in.</li>

          	<p>Manuscript accepted for publication: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287853557_Multilinear_Subspace_Clustering">Multilinear Subspace Clustering</a>. Presented at the 2016 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.</p>
          	<p>This was my project as a summer NSF REU Fellow, working under Tufts professors Shuchin Aeron, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Misha Kilmer, Dept. of Mathematics. I inherited the work of a past thesis student, Eric Kernfeld, which included a theoretical model for processing multi-dimensional data that could be used to enhance existing subspace clustering algorithms such as Subspace Clustering via Thresholding (TSC) and Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC).</p>
          	<p>The manuscript linked above provides a detailed description of the theory behind the data model, but the basic idea is that we can preserve the structure of 2 (or higher) dimensional data rather than "vectorizing" it (stacking rows or columns into a single vector) as previous models did. In the case of 2 dimensions, this would, in theory, preserve similarity both horizontally and vertically rather than having to choose one dimension, thereby increasing accuracy. The algorithm would also allow us to deal with much larger data more efficiently; for a N x M matrix we select and process single fibers of size N and M separately, whereas vectorizing the same data results in a vector of size N*M.</p>
          	<p>My work included implementing and testing the algorithm on real data sets such as the Yale Faces dataset and the Olivetti Faces dataset. The results can be seen in tables within the manuscript.</p>
          	<p>All implementation and testing was done in Matlab, but unfortunately I cannot display my code as the manuscript is not yet published.</p>

            <p>My final project for my Mobile Software Development class at AIT-Budapest, I developed this Android app with a friend, Jake Watton. The overview is laid out in the README on the Github page for the project, but the idea is to develop a competition-based calorie burning app that would provide users with incentive to workout, by rewarding hard work with prizes such as equipment and gym memberships (this would be a later stage of the app once users were buying the app). We were planning to make use of the Fitbit API to ensure users' honesty, but unfortunately, it turned out that Fitbit only has a web api, and it would have required more time than we had. So as of now it cannot verify or pull data from Fitbit, but it has the capability for users to work towards personal goals and objectives, and keep track of their total running and calorie burning statistics in various time increments.</p>
            <p>The layout of the app is rooted in a navigation drawer, which has options to visit screens for personal information and statistics, personal goals, objectives (that we provide and the user tries to fulfill), and competitions (again, that we provide but all users can enter). We use local storage (Sugar ORM) for personal goals, as users can set these themselves. We use Backendless to store a User's information plus their status in competitions and objectives. We also use Backendless to set the objectives and competitions for the users to see and enter and work toward.</p>
            <p>The goal is to continue to work on this project whenever we have time, with the obvious next step being to incorporate Fitbit in order to take Users' workout data straight from there. Once we do that, we can begin to market it as an app with a competitive aspect, rather than just a personal gain type of app.</p>

              <p>My first Android project, a classic Minesweeper game, with the option for 3 different board sizes (as seen in the example screen shot). A user can toggle a "place flag" / "go mining" button to determine the action that will be taken upon touch. The game determines when the user has won or lost, based on flags placed, non-bomb spaces uncovered, or a bomb hit.</p>

              <p>A shopping list app, where a user can arrange items by category. Provided are 6 categories, including a miscellaneous option, for the user to choose from for each item, allowing for easier shopping later on. The user can enter a description and an expected price for each item (price in Hungarian forints as I developed this while living in Budapest), and at any point can edit this information by clicking on the details button. A simple swipe of the item off the screen or a check in the box plus a click of the "delete checked" button in the toolbar will remove an item.</p>
