            <h1 id="bio_header">about me</h1>
            <p>I am currently a 2nd year student at Tufts University, double majoring in computer science and mathematics.</p>
            <p><br />I am from Williamstown, MA, and I attended Mount Greylock Regional High School, where I captained the varsity soccer and basketball teams and was a member of the varsity tennis team. I was the first chair trumpet in the school band, and was the treasurer of the Student Council as well as our National Honor Society chapter.</p>
            <p><br />Here at Tufts, I play on the varsity soccer team, so I spend the bulk of my non-academic time on soccer related activities. I also play the trumpet in the university wind ensemble.</p>
            <p><br />My interests include anything involving sports of any sort (primarily soccer, basketball, baseball, tennis, football), music of every variety (everything from classical to country), any good tv shows or movies that are currently out, videogames, hiking, travelling, skiing, and many more. I'm a huge fan of the New England Patriots, Boston Red Sox, and really every Boston sports team. I have a ridiculous sweet tooth, and I don't think I've ever come across a dessert I didn't like.</p>
