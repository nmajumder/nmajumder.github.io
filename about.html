        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nathan Majumder. I am currently in my 4th and final year at Tufts University, where I'm double majoring in computer science and mathematics.</p>
        <p>I'm originally from Williamstown, MA, a tiny town nestled in the corner of Massachusetts bordering Vermont and New York. I attended Mount Greylock, a small regional high school where I captained the varsity soccer and basketball teams and was a member of the varsity tennis team. I was first chair trumpet in the school band and was the treasurer of the Student Council as well as our chapter of the National Honor Society.</p>
        <p>Here at Tufts, my main time commitment outside of academics is participation on the varsity soccer team, for which I was elected captain for my senior year. Playing soccer forces me to manage my time and can often be stressful, but I absolutely love being a part of the team and the friendships I've made through it. To top it off, we recently won the 2014 D3 National Championship, which was one of the most exhilarating and memorable experiences of my life. I also play the trumpet in the university wind ensemble as much as my soccer commitments allow, and I have been a TA for the introductory computer science class on campus.</p>
        <p>My interests include any activity involving playing or watching sports (I'm a huge Boston sports fan, especially of the Patriots and Red Sox), playing and listening to music (I like to fiddle around on pianos whenever possible and make use of all those lessons my mom made me take when I was younger!), eating -- especially desserts, watching any good tv shows and movies that are out, playing videogames, skiing, hiking, travelling (if/when my budget allows), and much more.</p>
        <p>I recently returned from a semester in Budapest, Hungary where I was studying in a computer science program called AIT-Budapest with about 70 other students, mostly from America. I had the time of my life and fell in love with Budapest, while also travelling around to many other European countries. Check out some of the pictures from my trip in the <a href="abroad.html">Abroad</a> page of my website!</p>
